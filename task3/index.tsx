// 1) Whatâ€™s wrong with this code snippet?
//    On the 10th line array index is used as react key

// 2) How can we improve it?
//    Instead of key={i} should be used key={book.id}, because it's unique and won't change across rerenders
//    Also we can remove i from parameters of map function as it becomes unused

// 3) Are there any cases when this code can be used with no modification?
//    We can use array indexes as keys only if array won't dynamically change and we don't have any unique stable ids for items
